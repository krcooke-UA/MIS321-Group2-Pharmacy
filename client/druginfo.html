          <p>I'm looking for something that can deliver a 50-pound payload of snow on a small feminine target. Can you suggest something? Hello? </p>

          <h2>Atorvastatin</h2>
          <p>Atorvastatin is a statin used to treat high cholesterol. It is still one of the most commonly prescribed statins, and though not as inexpensive as simvastatin (Zocor), the generic price has continued to drop.</p>

        <h2>Lisinopril</h2>
        <p>Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril) is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure, and in combination with other medications to treat heart failure. Lisinopril was the third ACE inhibitor to become available. It may be more convenient than some of the other options because it is longer-acting, meaning you only need to take one tablet per day rather than two or three.</p>

        <p>Adrenergic bronchodilators are medicines that open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.</p>
